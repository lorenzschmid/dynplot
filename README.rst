dynplot
=======

Extends matplotlib's pyplot.plot() to allow for repetitive plotting

There is no simple way to update multiple lines repetitively and continuously of an existing figure in `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_. Using this class as drop-in replacement for matplotlib's pyplot, the figure's line will be updated upon every call of the ``plot()`` method and create thus a dynamic plot, constantly refreshing.

**Current limitations**:

- Only the ``plot`` function is supported.
- The figure and axes are only configurable via the internal ``fig`` and ``ax`` attribute, i.e. the following call will _fail_:

  >>> dplt.title('Will fail!')

- ``dynplot.plot()`` only accepts plotting if x and y data are given

**Example**:

>>> from dynplot import dplt
>>> from math import sin, pi
>>>
>>> dplt = dplt()
>>> for i in range(100):
>>>     x = range(i, i+20)
>>>     y = [sin(2*pi*x/20) for x in x]
>>>     dplt.plot(x, y)
>>>     _ = dplt.ax.set_title('Wave')
>>>     dplt.show()
